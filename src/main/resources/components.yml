  PHOENIX_FEATHER:
    lore:
      - Forged from the molten core of a long-extinct volcano,
      - the phoenix rod bore an intricately carved shaft adorned with runes that glowed like embers.
      - When wielded, it crackled with the rejuvenating energy of a phoenix,
      - capable of both destruction and rebirth at the conjurer's command.
